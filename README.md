# Investigating 3D generalization

A PyTorch implementation for the paper [***Investigating 3D Generalization in Deep Neural Networks***](https://arxiv.org/abs/).

## Execution

The Unity project for generating different views of the 3D paperclip / real-world objects is located in `Unity3D`.
Detailed instructions about how to generate these datasets can be found in the corresponding folder.

The training scripts are located in `Trainer/`.
Please see the corresponding folder for more details.
